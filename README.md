# Data-Warehouse-Project
A data warehouse is a large, centralized storage system that collects data from multiple sources, organizes it, and makes it easier to analyze for decision-making.  In this project, the goal is to design and build a data warehouse that stores historical data from various systems such as sales records, customer information, and product data.
